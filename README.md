## Getting Started

Welcome to the Java project by SIUT students,the project was created for the presentation of acquired knowledge in Java. Here is a guideline to help you get started read the project.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains three folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain packages
- `steps`: the folder to maintain project-steps
- `temp` : the folder to maintain templates

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
