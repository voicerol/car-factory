- Apply the following items to your project:
    - Create at least 3 packages with meaningful names and add the related classes with proper names and content to each one(at least 2 classes for each package)
    - Import 2 packages to the classes that do not belong to the same packages and finally try to use them in the package and class that contain the main method
    - Use scanner class in different classes to take different types of input.
